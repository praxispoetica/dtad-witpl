## Works by v. o. kapelman

This site features works by v. o. kapelman, author of the novel Denying the Amerikan Dream.

I was born the son of Jews and that gives me the responsibility to support the struggle for Palestine to be free, from the river to the sea, where the Palestinian people and any person who respects, supports and struggles for that may live, grow, prosper, free of Zionist and US imperialist genocide.

Because since Masada, which was the struggle against our occupation by the Romans in the times of a Jewish prophet called Jesus more than two thousand years ago, we Jews have gone to live all over the world, anywhere but in Palestine, have we gone to live. And, if we didn't bow down to Imperial Rome, neither will we to Zionism, or to yanqui imperialism.

As Jews, as everyone else, we have to do anything but shy away from the struggle against genocide practiced against the Palestinian people by anti-semitic Zionism (the Palestinian people are semites; semites, to the core, and so are we Jews).

So this site features works by v. o. kapelman, author of the novel "Denying the Amerikan Dream".

Included here are poems, flash fiction pieces, short stories, novels, and works which are collections of each.
