        description="To support my writing practice, please simply click on this card to visit my Substack page, and then please click on the red `Subscribe` button in the top right-hand menu. If you like the idea of seeing individual poems, flash fiction pieces, and short stories, way before they are published here in collections, please hit that red subscription button. That way, again, at no cost at all, you will be notified of new writings as they are published. About once or twice a month. And you will be invited to special chat sessions, readings, and other events. All free of charge, simple, secure and straightforward; what I most wish to do is form a healthy reader community with whom I can share my works and feel I am accompanied in my efforts. Thank you for that support! That's how you can help me most. Thank you!"
