If you like the idea of seeing individual poems, flash fiction pieces, and short stories, way before they are published here in collections, please hit that red subscription button. That way, again, at no cost at all, you will be notified of new writings as they are published. About once or twice a month. And you will be invited to special chat sessions, readings, and other events. All free of charge, simple, secure and straightforward; what I most wish to do is form a healthy reader community with whom I can share my works and feel I am accompanied in my efforts.
