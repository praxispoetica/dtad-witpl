## PraxisPoetica V. Step 2. The Pivotal Character Who Must Win By Any Means Necessary

- [tbd]

I'm postponing PraxisPoetica Notes until I complete [the Novel](/works/novels/dtad-witpl/dtad-witpl/), which is what all of us actually want to read

I have stabilized the PraxisPoetica process, for this novel at least, mainly based on the approaches I've been discussing in regard to the immense contributions made to the modern writing process thanks to the life work of Lajos Egri.

- A basic starter bibliography might be:

- Aristotle, *Poetics*
- [E. M. Forster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._M._Forster), *Aspects of the Novel*, 1927 (introduces healthy anti-Aristotle approach)
- Richard Wright, [Blueprint for Negro Writing, 1937](https://thirtiesculture.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/wright-blueprint.pdf)
- [Lajos Egri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lajos_Egri)

  - [The Art of Creative Writing: The Classic Guide to Writing Fiction, 1965](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Creative-Writing-Classic-Fiction-ebook/dp/B08MWYT1TH)
  - John Yorke, [Into the Woods - How Stories Work and How We Tell Them, 2015](https://www.johnyorkestory.com/about/the-book/) (One of the few writers to explain the importance of Lajos Egri's contribution to the writing process)

  - [James Scott Bell, *Write Your Novel From the Middle*, 2014-02-23](https://jamesscottbell.com/styled-7/styled-35/index.html) Introduces concept of *midpoint* (self-realization, commitment of protagoinist to their goal) (do not confuse with the concept of Lajos Egri and Lisa Cron's concept *media res* in which the novel manuscript starts (inciting incident) after the first half of the protaginist's struggles have already been in play during their lifetime)
- [Alice Sutlow, Developmental Editor & Book Coach of Young Adult Fiction & Beyond](https://alicesudlow.com/)
  - An editor, focusing mainly upon manuscript revision. However in our concept of PraxisPoetica, very valuable in terms of iterative and incremental writing process right from the start.
  - Article [The 6 Essential Elements of Every Novel, Act, and Scene](https://alicesudlow.com/story-structure-elements/) (recognizable from Lajos Egri and *ergo* modern screenwriting)
